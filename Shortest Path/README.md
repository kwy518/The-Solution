Given a 2D array with values as `S`, `D`, `1` and `0`.
  - S is the Source.
  - D is the Destination.
  - 1 marks the valid path.
  - 0 marks the obstacle.
  
Find the shortest distance from S to D avoiding all the obstacles.

----------
For example:

|S|0|1|1|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|1|0|1|
|0|1|1|1|
|1|0|D|1|


In the above matrix, it takes 5 distances from S to D.
